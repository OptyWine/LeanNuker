# LeanNuker by †⸸Ｐ６８０👁

🔥 **LeanNuker** - A fast, raw Go tool to mess with Discord servers. Create channels, roles, ban members, or rename servers. Built for speed, no fluff. 😈

## Setup
- **Go**: Install Go 1.20+ (No Need More).
- **Token**: Grab a Discord bot token from https://discord.com/developers.
- **Guild ID**: Get your server’s ID (right-click server > Copy ID).
- **Run**: Download [`LeanNuker.exe`](https://github.com/OptyWine/LeanNuker/releases/latest/download/LeanNuker.exe) and Run it. Enter token and guild ID when prompted.
- **JavaScript?**: Nah, this is pure Go, but enable JavaScript in your browser if you’re testing API calls manually (e.g., via Discord’s dev tools). 🖥️

## Features
- Bulk create channels/roles (same name, no numbering).
- Delete all channels/roles.
- Ban all members (ouch).
- Change server name.
- Purple/pink vibes, 10 concurrent requests, 500ms delays.

## Warning
This is for **learning only**. Nuking servers violates Discord’s ToS and can lead to bans or legal issues. Don’t do dumb shit. Build something cool instead, like a moderation bot. Hit up the sponsor server for ideas! 😎
